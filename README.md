**Note**: 
  * The victoria.json.zip file needs to be extracted before running the notebook. If you encounter errors related to missing data, please ensure that the file has been properly extracted.
  * To view the choropleth interactive map components, please note that these files are quite large (60Mb) and as such, cannot be uploaded to Github. Therefore, when running the Jupyter file on your local machine, please ensure that you uncomment the code containing fig1.show(), fig2.show(), and fig3.show() to view these maps. Alternatively, these maps have been extracted and uploaded to https://bootcamp-5c04a.web.app/?fbclid=IwAR2GTy10tnQ_sjSKAZgUQKfPtniiMgDcySIMybEczez5mRTIuz_guV38F8s, for your convenience.
